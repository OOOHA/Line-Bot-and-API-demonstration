# Line-Bot-and-API-demonstration 
This is a message app chat bot and API demonstration.

## About this repositary 
This README is going to be ritten in English although Line is an Message app only popular in Taiwan.  
You might need know **mandairn** but you can trasnlate the webpage into your perfer language by google translate in google Chrome via right click.  
There is a Chrome extension called [Google Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb/RK%3D2/RS%3DBBFW_pnWkPY0xPMYsAZI5xOgQEE-). This extension can translate words show on the webpage.  

This is just to show how to use a API in google colab.
I **DO NOT** recommand this app at all because of the reasons below:
* Your older photos or files in the chat will be "Expired" after some days.
* It's a Buggy  App.
* The App is slow.
* The app takes a lot of storage from your phone even if you clean all the chches and chat history.
* The app is full of ads.
* The UI/UX is so bad. 
* It's just like a bloatware.

# Install and setup in google colab

Download Ngrok and unzip the file
```
!wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz -O ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz
!tar xzvf ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz
```
Install Ngrok  
PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like.  
Usually er only need to use **pip install** instad of **!pip install** while using VSCode.[pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/#)or[install pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

Now, let's set the authorizationth token.  
Please put your authorizationth cone in the **"Your authorizationth token"**

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok, conf
ngrok.set_auth_token("Your authorizationth token")
```

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok
def connNgrok():
	port=5000

	public_url=ngrok.connect(port, bind_tls=True).public_url
	print(" * ngrok tunnel \"{}\" -> \"http://127.0.0.1:{}/\"".format(public_url, port))
```
