<h1> Line-Bot-and-API-demonstration </h1>
This is a message app chat bot and API demonstration.

<h2> About this repositary </h2>
<p>This README is going to be ritten in English although Line is an Message app only popular in Taiwan.<br />
   This is just to show how to use a API in google colab.
I <strong> DO NOT </strong> recommand this app at all because of the reasons below:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Your older photos or files in the chat will be "Expired" after some days.</li>
  <li> It's a Buggy  App.</li>
  <li> The App is slow. </li>
  <li> The app takes a lot of storage from your phone even if you clean all the chches and chat history.</li>
  <li> The app is full of ads. </li>
  <li> The UI/UX is so bad. </li>
  <li> It's just like a bloatware. </li>
</ol>
